1. MIB Browser's splash screen displayed longer than usually
------------------------------------------------------------

Problem Description
-------------------

Sometimes, MIB Browser cannot properly initialize a notifications
receiving module at startup. In this case the program startup takes
longer than usually. This behavior is mostly related to the
Microsoft's SNMP Trap service.

Symptoms
--------

The MIB Browser's splash screen, which is normally shown only for
a few seconds at the program startup, remains displayed for a few
minutes showing a notice 'Registering Notifications...'.

Solution
--------

Check if you have the Microsoft's SNMP Trap service running or not.
If not, set the service to 'Automatic' startup at boot time (or
disable it, if you do not need it), but do NOT configure it for
'Manual' startup.

Also, if you installed Microsoft SNMP service when a certain service
pack was already installed on that computer, you must re-apply
the same (or newer) service pack. Otherwise, the newly installed SNMP
Service may not function properly.

2. General guidelines for reporting the problem
-----------------------------------------------

Before reporting the problem, make sure that you are using the latest
version of the software as available from MG-SOFT's download page at
http://www.mg-soft.com/download.html. Report the problem only in case
you can reproduce it by using the latest version of the software and
you cannot find a suitable problem solution description in this document.

In order to receive a prompt and accurate response from the support
team, provide the following information when reporting a problem:

 1. For which software title are you reporting the problem?

 2. Are you using the licensed or evaluation version of the
    software? If licensed, attach the SERIAL.TXT file that you
    received with the license.key file when you licensed the
    software.

 3. If the application has the "Help|Support" option in the
    main menu, send us the complete output of that function.
    Otherwise, let us know exactly which version of the
    software are you using? Please report both, the version
    displayed in the software's About window as well as the
    version obtained by right-clicking the EXE or DLL file in
    the Windows Explorer and by selecting the Properties item
    from the pop-up menu. In the File Properties dialog select
    the Version tab and let us know the version listed there.

 4. Which operating system are you using (Windows XP, Windows
    Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7,
    Windows Server 2012, Windows 8)? Which service pack is 
    installed on that operating system?

 5. Did you install the software as Administrator?
    Do you have administrative privileges when running the software?

 6. Do you have any other SNMP or network management software
    installed on that computer? Or any other kind of software
    that may interfere with MG-SOFT's software. If yes, which?

 7. Can you reproduce the problem on any other computer?
    What is the operating system running on the other computer?

 8. Describe the exact step-by-step procedure to reproduce
    the problem.

 9. When reporting problems related to MIB Compiler (i.e.,
    when you are unable to compile a MIB file), zip the MIB file
    and all MIBs that are imported by the MIB, and e-mail the zip
    file along with your support application.

10. Do you have a firewall running on your PC or on your
    network that is blocking certain TCP and UDP ports, which
    could prevent normal operation of MG-SOFT's software products?


Please e-mail answers to the above questions to <support@mg-soft.si>.
