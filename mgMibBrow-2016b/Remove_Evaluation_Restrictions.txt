APPLY FOR A 30-DAY EVALUATION license.key FILE

The evaluation version of MG-SOFT's software products without
a valid license.key file will operate in restricted mode,
while some applications will not start at all. For efficient
evaluation of MG-SOFT's software products, with most features
enabled, we invite you to apply for a 30-day evaluation
license key by submitting the on-line form at

http://www.mg-soft.com/evalKeyReq.html

or by contacting <sales@mg-soft.com>.

Make sure to request evaluation license key file for the
correct OS where you will be evaluating the software - we
issue evaluation license key files for Windows, Linux, Mac OS X
and Solaris operating systems. Note that for NETCONF and YANG
software products you need license key file for "JAVA" and
this license key file can then be used for running NETCONF
and YANG software products on any OS that supports Java.

Evaluation license key files are delivered by e-mail. For
security reasons, we do not ship license keys to e-mail
addresses at free or web-based e-mail providers! In order
to receive a 30-day evaluation license key, provide your
regular e-mail address!

MG-SOFT reserves the right to refuse any evaluation license
key application without notice.
